British-PHP!
===========

An interpreter for a British dialect of our loved and hated PHP.

Why?
-------
Well, why not?
I first came across the idea when I saw this blog post:

By Dave Child

And then I Just decided there is nothing to lose in working 30 minutes to write this script...

How to use?
-------
Why the hell would you want to use it?
Well, any way, the syntax is pretty clear from interperter.php
then all you have to do is write you British PHP files into .b files and run "php interpreter.php --file=[file-path]".
The command will translate it to PHP, evaluate it, and then write the PHP code into a new file
